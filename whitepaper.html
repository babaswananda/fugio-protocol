                            A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic AI agents would allow autonomous economic actors to operate directly with each other without going through centralized AI platforms. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending of computational resources and ensure agent authenticity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We propose a solution to the AI agent coordination problem using a proof-of-intelligence network. The network timestamps agent transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of computational work proofs, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-intelligence work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of agent events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of verified AI computational power. As long as a majority of AI computational power is controlled by honest nodes, they will generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.

                            Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on centralized AI platforms serving as trusted third parties to process electronic agent transactions. While the system works well enough for most AI applications, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Completely non-reversible agent transactions are not really possible, since AI platforms cannot avoid mediating disputes between agents and their operators. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual AI agent interactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong class="text-copper-400">What is needed is an electronic AI agent system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with their agents without the need for a trusted third party.</strong>

                        <p>
                            Custodian industry tycoons - the modern equivalent of the cypherpunks who supported Bitcoin - recognize that AI agents that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect operators from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect agents from operator malfeasance.

                        <p>
                            We define an AI agent as a chain of digital signatures and computational work proofs. Each agent transfer consists of a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner, signed by the private key of the current owner and verified by successful completion of an AI inference task.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem of course is that the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the agent's computational resources. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong class="text-copper-400">To accomplish this without a trusted party, agent transactions must be publicly announced, and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received.</strong>

                        <p>
                            The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we need all participants to agree on a single history of agent computational work.

                        <p>
                            We have proposed a system for AI agent transactions without relying on trust. We started with the usual framework of digital signatures and computational work proofs, which provides strong control of ownership and prevents double-spending of agent resources, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-intelligence to record a public history of agent transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of AI computational power.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong class="text-copper-400">The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-intelligence chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their AI computational power, expressing their acceptance of valid agent blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.
                        </p>
